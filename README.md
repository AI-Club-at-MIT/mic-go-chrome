# MIT MIC Go Chrome Extension

Fork of https://github.com/techx/hackmit-go-chrome

A Chrome extension for http://go.mitmic.io/

Just type `mi something` in the omnibar...

The extension also finds all instances of "go/whatever", even on Google Docs
and stuff, and automatically turns them into clickable links!

Get the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aebbebohffjpnifkhjninighbpimlgfl
